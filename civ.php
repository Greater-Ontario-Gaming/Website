                    <h2>What you can expect</h2>
                    <p>Civilians in the province of Ontario are responsible for creating compelling characters with deep back-stories that come out in a series of scenarios.  This group is responsible for generating the fun and excitement on patrol each night.</p>
                    <p>Civs are expected to provide a broad range of scenarios for the emergency services departments that vary in style, urgency, action, and outcomes.  Not every encounter should turn into a pursuit or involve gunfire.  Back-to-back priority calls is not often realistic.  Maybe the scenario is a simple speeding ticket, suspicious behaviour, or trespassing.  Sometimes being a civilian means roleplaying a victim rather than a perpetrator &mdash; for example, requesting help for a traffic accident, or a concerned wife calling 9-1-1 for her husband who has not returned home from his hunting day-trip in the mountains.</p>

                    <p>All civilians must go through our basic training program and a probationary period before being eligible to join patrol on their own.</p>
                    <p>As with the emergency services departments, Civilian Operations also has a chain of command.  Civilians who show their skill in creating deep character stories, interesting and engaging scenarios, and who show respect and leadership within the community may be rewarded with a promotion.  In a promoted position, you will have the opportunity to lead multi-civilian scenarios and may also gain access to more exotic vehicles and props.</p>
