                        <li><b>1300</b> - A staff member posts tonight's scheduled patrol on Discord.  All members are expected to react to the post to indicate whether or not they'll be joining that night's patrol.<br /><img class="wm-100" src="/Images/join-us-day-1.jpg" /></li>

                        <li><b>1830</b> - Patrol begins immediately following the briefing.  Log in to FiveM and join the server.<br />For first responders, you'll put on your uniform and spawn your assigned vehicle for the night.<br />For civilians, it's time to get into character and set up your first scenario!</li>

                    <p>To ensure everybody enjoys their experience at GTRP, we do have some rules that all members are expected to follow.  Any member who fails to follow these rules will be disciplined with anything from a warning up to a permanent ban from the community.</p>
                    <ol class="spaced">
                        <li>Be respectful to all members regardless of rank, age, or color.
                        <br />&mdash; Swearing on the server is permitted but doing so excessively or in a manner that shows disrespect is not.
                        <br />&mdash; Any use of sexist, homophobic or racist terms (in or out of character) is not permitted.</li>

                        <li>
                            No cheating or exploiting.
                            <br />&mdash; Players can not use server bugs or game mechanics to exploit for personal gain. Players MUST report bugs immediately upon discovery.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            No server disruption.
                            <br />&mdash; Server disruption is, by definition, doing something that causes disorder in the server. This includes but is not limited to: mic spamming, chat spamming, spamming, and mass @

                            You MUST roleplay. Don't do things you can't in real life.
                            <br />&mdash; Failing to roleplay is strictly prohibited and will be met with consequences
                            <br />&mdash; When playing on the server, it is best if you do things in a manner that would be seen as realistic. Unrealistic behavior is considered FailRP and will result in staff action. These behaviors may include but aren't limited to: pulling a large gun out of nowhere, crashing into a large object and continuing on (even if your car isn't totaled by the in-game damage system), or ramping off a bridge, hill, or ramp and then continuing to drive.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            New life rule is always in effect.
                            <br />&mdash; If you die, are jailed, or are hospitalized you may not continue roleplay with that character, or return to the scene as a new character
                            <br />&mdash; If you are downed, and respawn or are picked up, you can not remember the last 15 minutes including but not limited to: individuals you interacted with, vehicles you saw, how you were killed, and who killed you.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            No metagaming, powergaming, random deathmatch, cop baiting, or revenge killing.
                            <br />&mdash; Metagaming is defined as using out of character information for in character use.
                            <br />&mdash; Powergaming is defined as roleplaying on someone's behalf or doing something without giving a person a chance to react.
                            <br />&mdash; Random/Vehicle Deathmatch is "killing" someone without any roleplay or prior contact.
                            <br />&mdash; Cop baiting is purposely doing something in front of the cops in order to get their attention.
                            <br />&mdash; Revenge Killing is killing someone after you "die" even though you should've forgotten who killed you (NLR states you forget the last 15 minutes leading up to your death).
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            No arguing with, impersonating or pestering staff in-server. The staff has the final say.
                            <br />&mdash; Our admins work hard to keep the server happy but also come on the server to enjoy their time. Please give staff time to get back to you and do not bug them. If they do not acknowledge, they may be busy with a situation and can not reply. For server bugs, compensation issues, etc., players should consult the Discord in #Support
                            <br />&mdash; Staff members have final say in all matters. If you have an issue with a decision made by a Moderator, do not argue with them or other players. Please consult with a Admin
                        </li>

                        <li>Do not attempt to recruit, persuade, or intimidate anyone to join another community relating to FiveM doing so will result in a permanent ban from the community.</li>

                        <li>No bullying, soliciting, stalking, discriminating, or harassing.</li>

                        <li>No sexual content or scare content is to be shared.</li>

                        <li>No racial or sexual slurs are to be used against anyone</li>

                        <li>Do not threaten/intimidate the community or members of it physically, emotionally, or legally. Resolve problems "in-house" and utilize our staff to resolve conflicts.</li>

                        <li>Everyone must use the same Teamspeak Name format, First Initial, Last Name i.e. R. Tu | 385</li>

                        <li>Everyone must react to #scheduled-patrols unless they are just a Community Friend, failing to do so after a week will result in a warning, if it continues further action will be taken by staff as they see necessary</li>

                        <li>
                            Dual Clan Policy: You cannot be on any other FiveM community servers regardless during our official patrol times from 6pm ET to 11pm or whenever patrol ends daily. If you are caught doing so you will be kicked for violating our community guidelines and rules.
                        </li>

                        <li>Our devs will not do personal work for members of the community.  They are here to develop GTRP &mdash; not any other servers.  Requesting personal work not related to GTRP will result first in a written warning, then second offence will result in removal from the community.</li>

                        <li>
                            No explicit sexual themes are to be used during RP, many people in the community stream and record content for YouTube and more, and by using sexual themes we risk their channels.
                            <br />&mdash; If your scenario requires sexual themes, use "work around" phrases that aren't too explicit.
                        </li>

                        <li>Power Gaming is prohibited! Power gaming is putting yourself in situations where you cannot lose (I.e Holding up in positions where you can't be stopped, making it so there's absolutely no evidence at a scene ect) If you are caught doing this you will be removed from patrol without question.</li>

                        <li>You may not have any discord links or community recruitment things at all in your discord status.  Failure to remove these may result in a kick for attempting to recruit members of the community.</li>

                        <li>Do not bash other departments.  This causes discontent or friction in the community.  Snippits are okay (example, "oh you're in TPS, we won't hold that against you") but making fun of cars, command, uniforms, and so on will not be tolerated.</li>
