                    <p>Greater Ontario Roleplay is a group of gamers and Emergency Services ethusiasts who regularly get together online for some good roleplay fun in a private game of Grand Theft Auto V that is customized to look like the Ontario Area.</p>

                    <p>Using FiveM&trade;, we are able to host our own private Grand Theft Auto V online multiplayer server and customize it to look and feel like the Ontario Area.  Our custom textures, models, equipment, and scenarios create an immersive experience like none-other.</p>

                    <h2>Roleplay &amp; Realism</h2>
                    <p>Our game time is all about roleplaying situations as true-to-life as possible.  From the moment you enter the server, you're expected to be in character.  We have a real chain-of-command, daily pre-patrol briefings, realistic radio talk, and calls and interactions that would actually happen in Ontario.</p>
                    <p>A call isn't over when the driver has been arrested.  There is still lots to be done.  They must be read their rights and advised of the charges against them.  Their car also needs to be searched.  And a tow must be called to take the car away. Fire may need to attend to clean up a fuel spill, or perhaps EMS needs to tend to a minor injury on the suspect.  We play out the whole scenario!</p>
                    <p>Even the high-adrenaline calls remain realistic.  During pursuits, it's important to clear intersections and if the pursuit is getting too dangerous it may be called off.  If there's a hold-up at the 24/7 convenience store, we don't just run in guns-blazing.  Officers must secure the scene and call in ERT.</p>
                    <p class="text-large text-weight-light">The more realistic you play, the more fun it is for everybody in the community!</p>

                    <p>Just like a real organization, there is a chain of command at GORP.  Members who are engaged, follow our rules, and contribute positively to the community are rewarded with promotions.
