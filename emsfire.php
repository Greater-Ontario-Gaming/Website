                    <p>Toronto fire fighters and paramedics serve the civilians of not only Toronto, but also the surrounding areas.  Fire &amp; EMS may respond to fire calls, medical calls, or to assist the police on calls with injured civilians or officers.</p>
                    <p>Toronto Fire does more than just put out fires, visit the grocery store, cook, and sleep.  They use the jaws of life to help free trapped civilians from vehicles after a collision.  They clean up fuel spills.  And sometimes rescue civilians on mountainsides.  All other players on patrol &mdash; civilians and police &mdash; are responsible for involving the Toronto Fire &amp; EMS in the roleplay scenarios.</p>
